# Getting Started

In this tutorial, we will lead you through the process of creating a simple GraphQL backend application.

We'll use `GQLoom` with your favorite schema builder to define the GraphQL Resolver and Schema to build a simple cattery application that can query the cats in the cattery and can add new cats to the cattery.

You are going to use the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)：as an engine and runtime for our server;
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)：a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript giving you better tooling at any scale;
- [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)：a reference implementation of GraphQL for JavaScript;
- [graphql-yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server)：the easiest way to build an HTTP GraphQL server;
- `GQLoom`：define GraphQL Schema and resolvers more simply and efficiently.

You can use a familiar Schema Builder such as [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/), [Zod](https://zod.dev/), or even just use [GraphQL.js](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/).

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): version 20 or higher;

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and some knowledge of Valibot or Zod. If you are a beginner, we suggest you learn these basics first.

## Initialize the project
First, we need to create a new Node.js project.

Open your command line and run the following command:
```sh
mkdir cattery
cd cattery
npm init -y
```
In the above command: we created a new directory named `cattery` and entered it. Then, we initialize a new Node.js project using the `npm init -y` command and automatically generate a default `package.json` file.

## Install dependencies
Next, we need to install some necessary dependencies.
<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D typescript @types/node tsx" />
In this step, we installed TypeScript, the type definition for Node.js, and [tsx](https://tsx.is/). [tsx](https://tsx.is/) is a tool for running TypeScript in Node.js.

<PackageManagerTabs command="install graphql graphql-yoga" />
We also installed [graphql](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) and [graphql-yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) to help us run the GraphQL service.

### Choose a Schema Builder
<Tabs groupId='schema-builder'>
  <Tab label="valibot">
    <PackageManagerTabs command="install @gqloom/core valibot @gqloom/valibot" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab  label="zod">
    <PackageManagerTabs command="install @gqloom/core zod @gqloom/zod" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab  label="graphql.js">
    <PackageManagerTabs command="install @gqloom/core" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now, create a new [TypeScript profile](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) using the following command:
```sh
npx tsc --init
```

## Starting the project
First, we add a `dev` script to `package.json` to start our application:
```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts"
  }
  // ...
}
```

Then, we create an `src/index.ts` file and add the following code:
<Tabs groupId='schema-builder'>
  <Tab label="valibot">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { weave, resolver, query } from "@gqloom/core"
import { ValibotWeaver } from "@gqloom/valibot"
import * as v from "valibot"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga"

const HelloResolver = resolver({
  hello: query(v.string(), () => "Hello, World"),
})

export const schema = weave(ValibotWeaver, HelloResolver)

const yoga = createYoga({ schema })
createServer(yoga).listen(4000, () => {
  console.info("Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql")
})
```

In the code above: we define our GraphQL Resolver using `resolver` and `query`, we weave `CatResolver` into a GraphQL Schema with the `weave` function, and we start our GraphQL service with `graphql-yoga`.

  </Tab>
  <Tab label="zod">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { weave, resolver, query } from "@gqloom/zod"
import { z } from "zod"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga"

const HelloResolver = resolver({
  hello: query(z.string(), () => "Hello, World"),
})

export const schema = weave(HelloResolver)

const yoga = createYoga({ schema })
createServer(yoga).listen(4000, () => {
  console.info("Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql")
})
```

In the code above: we define our GraphQL Resolver using `resolver` and `query`, we weave `CatResolver` into a GraphQL Schema with the `weave` function, and we start our GraphQL service with `graphql-yoga`.

  </Tab>
  <Tab label="graphql.js">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { loom, silk, weave } from "@gqloom/core"
import { GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLString } from "graphql"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga"

const { resolver, query } = loom

const HelloResolver = resolver({
  hello: query(
    silk<string>(new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)),
    () => "Hello, World"
  ),
})

export const schema = weave(HelloResolver)

const yoga = createYoga({ schema })
createServer(yoga).listen(4000, () => {
  console.info("Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql")
})
```

In the code above: we define our GraphQL Resolver using `resolver` and `query`, we weave `CatResolver` into a GraphQL Schema with the `weave` function, and we start our GraphQL service with `graphql-yoga`.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now, you can run the following command to start your application:

<PackageManagerTabs command="run dev" />

You should see output similar to the following:
```sh
Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

You can open your browser and visit [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) and you will see a GraphQL playground where you can test your GraphQL queries:

For example, when we input:
```gql
query {
  hello
}
```
You should see the following output:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello, World"
  }
}
```

## Writing Code
Now that you've successfully started your GraphQL service, let's try to construct slightly more complex functionality.

### Defining the Cat type
Next, we define a `Cat` type with a `name` field and a `birthDate` field.
<Tabs groupId='schema-builder'>
  <Tab label="valibot">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import * as v from "valibot"

const Cat = v.object({
  __typename: v.nullish(v.literal("Cat")),
  name: v.string(),
  birthDate: v.string(),
})

interface ICat extends v.InferOutput<typeof Cat> {}
```
In the above code, we have used `v.object` to define the `Cat` type:
It has a `__typename` field with a value of `“Cat”`, which will be used as the name of this object when weaving the GraphQL Schema, and we also set `__typename` to `nullish` so that we don't have to carry the `__typename` property for each instance of `Cat` object at runtime This avoids having to carry the `__typename` property for each instance of `Cat` at runtime;
There is also a `name` field and a `birthDate` field, both of which are of type string.

Finally, we easily get the output type of `Cat` using `v.InferOutput` and name it `ICat`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="zod">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { z } from "zod"

const Cat = z.object({
  __typename: z.literal("Cat").nullish(),
  name: z.string(),
  birthDate: z.string(),
})

interface ICat extends z.infer<typeof Cat> {}
```
In the above code, we have used `z.object` to define the `Cat` type:
It has a `__typename` field with a value of `“Cat”`, which will be used as the name of this object when weaving the GraphQL Schema, and we also set `__typename` to `nullish` so that we don't have to carry the `__typename` property for each instance of `Cat` object at runtime This avoids having to carry the `__typename` property for each instance of `Cat` at runtime;
There is also a `name` field and a `birthDate` field, both of which are of type string.

Finally, we easily obtained the output type of `Cat` using `z.infer` and named it `ICat`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="graphql.js">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { silk } from "@gqloom/core"
import { GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLString } from "graphql"

interface ICat {
  name: string
  birthDate: string
}

const Cat = silk<ICat>(
  new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: "Cat",
    fields: {
      name: { type: GraphQLString },
      birthDate: { type: GraphQLString },
    },
  })
)
```
In the code above, we use `silk` to define the `Cat` type:
`silk` accepts `ICat` as a generic parameter, `ICat` is an interface that defines the fields that the `Cat` type should have;
We then use `GraphQLObjectType` to define the `Cat` type, which has two fields: `name` and `birthDate`, both of which are of type `GraphQLString`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

`GQLoom` will weave the `Cat` type we just defined into a GraphQL Schema:
```gql
type Cat {
  name: String!
  birthDate: String!
}
```

### Managing data

To manage our data, we simply use a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) object to store `Cat` instances:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const catMap = new Map<string, ICat>([
  ["Tom", { name: "Tom", birthDate: "2023-03-03" }],
])
```
:::tip
In this tutorial, we are storing the data directly using JavaScript's `Map` object for the purpose of code simplicity. This will store the data in memory and when the server restarts, the data will be lost.

In practice, you may need to use a more robust data persistence storage solution, such as a database.
:::

### Defining the query operation

The `query` operation is the entry point to the GraphQL Schema that allows clients to query data.

Now, let's go back to the beginning with `CatResolver` and add a `query` operation to it called `cats` which returns all `Cat` instances:

<Tabs groupId='schema-builder'>
  <Tab label="valibot">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { weave, resolver, query } from "@gqloom/core"
import { ValibotWeaver } from "@gqloom/valibot"
import * as v from "valibot"

const CatResolver = resolver({ // [!code hl]
  cats: query(v.array(Cat), () => Array.from(catMap.values())), // [!code hl]
}) // [!code hl]

const HelloResolver = resolver({
  hello: query(v.string(), () => "Hello, World"),
})

export const schema = weave(ValibotWeaver, HelloResolver, CatResolver) // [!code hl]
```
In the code above, we use the `resolver` function to define `CatResolver` and add a `query` operation named `cats` that returns all `Cat` instances.
The `query` function takes two arguments:
  - The first argument is the output type of `cats`, which you can pass directly into the `valibot` schema, in this case `v.array(Cat)`; the second argument is a parser function, which returns all instances of `Cat`.
  - The second argument is a parser function where we define the specific resolving logic for `cats`, where we use the `Array.from` function to convert `catMap` to an array and use it as the return value for `cats`.

In addition, we also weave together `CatResolver` and `HelloResolver` using the `weave` function to create the final GraphQL Schema.
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="zod">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { weave, resolver, query } from "@gqloom/zod"
import { z } from "zod"

const CatResolver = resolver({
  cats: query(z.array(Cat), () => Array.from(catMap.values())), // [!code hl]
})

const HelloResolver = resolver({
  hello: query(z.string(), () => "Hello, World"),
})

export const schema = weave(HelloResolver, CatResolver)
```
In the code above, we use the `resolver` function to define `CatResolver` and add a `query` operation named `cats` that returns all `Cat` instances.
The `query` function takes two arguments:
  - The first argument is the output type of `cats`, which you can pass directly into the `zod` schema, in this case `z.array(Cat)`; the second argument is a parsing function, which returns all instances of `Cat`.
  - The second argument is a parser function where we define the specific resolving logic for `cats`, where we use the `Array.from` function to convert `catMap` to an array and use it as the return value for `cats`.

In addition, we also weave together `CatResolver` and `HelloResolver` using the `weave` function to create the final GraphQL Schema.
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="graphql.js">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { weave, silk, loom } from "@gqloom/core"
import { GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLString } from "graphql"
const { resolver, query } = loom

const CatResolver = resolver({
  cats: query(silk.list(Cat), () => Array.from(catMap.values())),, // [!code hl]
})

const HelloResolver = resolver({
  hello: query(
    silk<string>(new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)),
    () => "hello, World"
  ),
})

export const schema = weave(HelloResolver, CatResolver)
```
In the code above, we use the `resolver` function to define `CatResolver` and add a `query` operation named `cats` that returns all `Cat` instances.
The `query` function takes two arguments:
  - The first argument is the output type of `cats`, which accepts a `silk` object, where we pass in `silk.list(Cat)` (the `silk.list` function accepts a `silk` object as an argument and returns a `silk` object representing an array of that object); and the second argument is a parsing function.
  - The second argument is a parser function where we define the specific resolving logic for `cats`, where we use the `Array.from` function to convert `catMap` to an array and use it as the return value for `cats`.

In addition, we also weave together `CatResolver` and `HelloResolver` using the `weave` function to create the final GraphQL Schema.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Let's try to access the `cats` operation in the playground:
```gql
query cats {
  cats {
    name
    birthDate
  }
}
```
You should see the following output:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "cats": [
      {
        "name": "Tom",
        "birthDate": "2023-03-03"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Defining input

Next, we define a `query` operation called `cat` that takes a `name` argument and returns the instance of `Cat` matching that `name`:
<Tabs groupId='schema-builder'>
  <Tab label="valibot">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { resolver, query } from "@gqloom/core"
import * as v from "valibot"

const CatResolver = resolver({
  cats: query(v.array(Cat), () => Array.from(catMap.values())),

  cat: query(v.nullish(Cat), { // [!code hl]
    input: { // [!code hl]
      name: v.string(), // [!code hl]
    }, // [!code hl]
    resolve: ({ name }) => catMap.get(name), // [!code hl]
  }), // [!code hl]

  hello: query(v.string(), () => "Hello, World"),
})
```
In the code above, we add a `query` operation called `cat` to `CatResolver`.

Similar to `cats`, the `query` function used to build `cat` takes as its first argument the `nullish` type of `Cat`, which means that the return value of the `cat` operation can be of type `null` or `Cat`.

In the second argument, we still pass a parser function, but this time we pass an additional `input` parameter that defines the input type for the `cat` operation.
The `input` parameter is an object containing an attribute named `name`, which is of type `string`. When the `cat` operation is accessed, `GQLoom` internally calls the `parse` function of `valibot` to ensure that the value of the `name` parameter matches the `string` type.

In the resolve function, we get the value of the `name` parameter from the first parameter of the `resolve` function, TypeScript infers the type of the `name` parameter to be `string`, and we use the `catMap.get` method to get the instance of `Cat` that corresponds to the `name`, which is used as the return value of the `cat` operation. as the return value of the `cat` operation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="zod">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { resolver, query } from "@gqloom/zod"
import { z } from "zod"

const CatResolver = resolver({
  cats: query(z.array(Cat), () => Array.from(catMap.values())),

  cat: query(Cat.nullish(), { // [!code hl]
    input: { // [!code hl]
      name: z.string(), // [!code hl]
    }, // [!code hl]
    resolve: ({ name }) => catMap.get(name), // [!code hl]
  }), // [!code hl]

  hello: query(z.string(), () => "Hello, World"),
})
```
In the code above, we add a `query` operation called `cat` to `CatResolver`.

Similar to `cats`, the `query` function used to build `cat` takes as its first argument the `nullish` type of `Cat`, which means that the return value of the `cat` operation can be of type `null` or `Cat`.

The `input` parameter is an object containing an attribute named `name`, which is of type `string`. When the `cat` operation is accessed, `GQLoom` internally calls the `parse` function of `zod` to ensure that the value of the `name` parameter matches the `string` type.

In the resolve function, we get the value of the `name` parameter from the first parameter of the `resolve` function, TypeScript infers the type of the `name` parameter to be `string`, and we use the `catMap.get` method to get the instance of `Cat` that corresponds to the `name`, which is used as the return value of the `cat` operation. as the return value of the `cat` operation.

  <Tab label="graphql.js">

  cat: query(silk.nullable(Cat), { // [!code hl]
    input: { // [!code hl]
      name: silk<string>(new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)), // [!code hl]
    }, // [!code hl]
    resolve: ({ name }) => catMap.get(name), // [!code hl]
  }), // [!code hl]

  hello: query(
    silk<string>(new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)),
    () => "hello, World"
  ),
})
```

Let's try to access the `cat` operation in the playground:

```gql
query cat {
  cat(name: "Tom") {
    name
    birthDate
  }
}
```

You should see the following output:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "cat": {
      "name": "Tom",
      "birthDate": "2023-03-03"
    }
  }
}
```

### Defining the mutation operation

The `mutation` operation is used to modify data, such as creating, updating, or deleting data.

Now, let's add a `mutation` operation named `createCat` to `CatResolver` that takes a `name` parameter and returns a `Cat` instance.

<Tabs groupId='schema-builder'>
  <Tab label="valibot">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { resolver, query, mutation } from "@gqloom/core"
import * as v from "valibot"

const CatResolver = resolver({
  cats: query(v.array(Cat), () => Array.from(catMap.values())),

  cat: query(v.nullish(Cat), {
    input: {
      name: v.string(),
    },
    resolve: ({ name }) => catMap.get(name),
  }),

  createCat: mutation(Cat, { // [!code hl]
    input: { // [!code hl]
      name: v.string(), // [!code hl]
      birthDate: v.string(), // [!code hl]
    }, // [!code hl]
    resolve: ({ name, birthDate }) => { // [!code hl]
      const cat = { name, birthDate } // [!code hl]
      catMap.set(name, cat) // [!code hl]
      return cat // [!code hl]
    }, // [!code hl]
  }), // [!code hl]

  hello: query(v.string(), () => "Hello, World"),
})
```

In the code above, we have added a `mutation` operation named `createCat` to `CatResolver`.

The input to the `mutation` function is the same as the `query` function.

Here, the `createCat` operation has a return type of `Cat` and accepts as input two parameters, `name` and `birthDate`, both of which are of type `string`.

In the parser function, we can easily get the values of the `name` and `birthDate` parameters from the first parameter, TypeScript will infer their types for us, and then we create a new `Cat` instance, add it to the `catMap`, and finally return the `Cat` instance.
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="zod">
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { resolver, query, mutation } from "@gqloom/zod"
import { z } from "zod"

const CatResolver = resolver({
  cats: query(z.array(Cat), () => Array.from(catMap.values())),

  cat: query(Cat.nullish(), {
    input: {
      name: z.string(),
    },
    resolve: ({ name }) => catMap.get(name),
  }),

  createCat: mutation(Cat, { // [!code hl]
    input: { // [!code hl]
      name: z.string(), // [!code hl]
      birthDate: z.string(), // [!code hl]

    resolve: ({ name, birthDate }) => { // [!code hl]
      const cat = { name, birthDate } // [!code hl]
      catMap.set(name, cat) // [!code hl]
      return cat // [!code hl]
    }, // [!code hl]
  }), // [!code hl]

  hello: query(z.string(), () => "Hello, World"),
})
```

  cat: query(silk.nullable(Cat), {

Let's try to create a new `Cat` instance in the playground:

```gql
mutation createCat {
  createCat(name: "Nala", birthDate: "2020-01-01") {
    name
    birthDate
  }
}
```

You should see results similar to the following:

{
  "data": {
    "createCat": {
      "name": "Nala",
      "birthDate": "2020-01-01"
    }
  }
}
```

Let's use the `cats` query to get all `Cat` instances:
```gql
query cats {
  cats {
    name
    birthDate
  }
}
```

You should see results similar to the following:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "cats": [
      {
        "name": "Tom",
        "birthDate": "2023-03-03"

      {
        "name": "Nala",
        "birthDate": "2020-01-01"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Defining fields

Now, let's try to define an `age` field for the `Cat` type.

The `age` field is not stored in the `Cat` instance, but is calculated on each query.

const CatResolver = resolver.of(Cat, { // [!code hl]
  age: field(v.pipe(v.number(), v.integer()), (cat) => { // [!code hl]
    const birthDate = new Date(cat.birthDate) // [!code hl]
    return new Date().getFullYear() - birthDate.getFullYear() // [!code hl]

    input: {
      name: v.string(),
    },
    resolve: ({ name }) => catMap.get(name),
  }),

  // ...
})
```
In the code above, we have added a `field` named `age` to `CatResolver`.

Notice that we used the `resolver.of` function instead of `resolver`.
The first argument to the `resolver.of` function is an object Schema, in this case `Cat`, which will be used as the `source` type for `CatResolver`;
In the second argument, we still pass in `query`, `mutation`, and `field` to define `CatResolver`.

In the `field` named `age`, we use `v.pipe(v.number(), v.integer())` to define the type of `age`, and `GQLoom` will weave the `age` field into a GraphQL `Int` type. Note that `GQLoom` does not execute a `parse` step on the output of a parser function by default, because the results produced inside a parser function are usually controllable and follow the TypeScript-derived type.

In the resolve function, we easily get the value of the `cat` instance from the first parameter, TypeScript will infer its type for us, then we convert the `cat` instance's `birthDate` field to a `Date` instance and calculate the difference between the current year and the year of the `birthDate`, and finally return the difference as the cat's age.

Let's try to visit the `cat` operation in the playground:

```gql
query cat {
  cat(name: "Tom") {

```

You should see the following output:

We can add an `input` object to a `field`, which will be used as the input parameter for that `field`.

## Summary

Very well, we have written a simple GraphQL APP that contains a `CatResolver`.
In the example we just learned:

- Define methods for `query`, `mutation` in `resolver`;
- Defining objects and fields using `valibot`, `zod` or `graphql.js`;
- Defining parsing functions and input parameters in `query`, `mutation`, `field`;
- Weave `CatResolver` and `HelloResolver` into a GraphQL Schema using the `weave` function and launch our GraphQL APP using `graphql-yoga`.


## Next step

- Check out the core concepts of GQLoom: [silk](./fundamentals/silk), [resolver](./fundamentals/resolver), [weave](./fundamentals/weave);
- Understanding common features: [context](./fundamentals/context), [DataLoader](./fundamentals/dataloader), [Middleware](./fundamentals/middleware)
- See [Valibot Integration](./schema-integration/valibot) for documentation on how to use `Valibot` to build more complex GraphQL objects and advanced types such as Union, Interface, and Enum.
- See [Zod Integration](./schema-integration/zod) documentation to learn how to use `Zod` to build more complex GraphQL objects and advanced types like Union, Interface, and Enum.
