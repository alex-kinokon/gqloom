# Apollo

[Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react).
It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.

## Installation

<PackageManagerTabs command="install graphql @apollo/server @gqloom/core" />

## Usage
```ts
import { weave } from "@gqloom/core"
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server"
import { startStandaloneServer } from "@apollo/server/standalone"
import { HelloResolver } from "./resolvers"

const schema = weave(HelloResolver)
const server = new ApolloServer({ schema })

startStandaloneServer(server, {
  listen: { port: 4000 },
}).then(({ url }) => {
  console.info(`ðŸš€  Server ready at: ${url}`)
})
```

## Context

The default context for `Apollo Server` is an empty object, you need to pass the context to the resolvers manually.
See the [Apollo Server documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/context) for more information.
