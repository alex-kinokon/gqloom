# Adapters

There are a number of GraphQL HTTP adapters in the Node.js ecosystem.

Since the product of the GQLoom weave is a standard GraphQL Schema object, it works seamlessly with these adapters.

Here are some popular adapters:

- [Yoga](./adapters/yoga): üßò Rewrite of a fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience. The core of Yoga implements WHATWG Fetch API and can run/deploy on any JS environment.

- [Apollo](./adapters/apollo): üåç Spec-compliant and production ready JavaScript GraphQL server that lets you develop in a schema-first way. Built for Express, Connect, Hapi, Koa, and more.

- [Mercurius](./adapters/mercurius): Implement GraphQL servers and gateways with Fastify.
